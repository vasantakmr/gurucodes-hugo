description: Style Guide for Contributing Content to gurucodes.io
---

This guide is for authors and developers who contribute content to gurucodes.io.
<!-- 
## Things to Know

Here are a few tips to keep in mind before working on this project:

- Feel free to pull request typos or obvious minor fixes (no issues or discussion necessary). 
- Discuss your article ideas on Slack first. 
- Content is managed with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and located under `hugo/content`. 
- If you contribute I want to make it worth-your-while (see tier below)

### Contribution Tier

I like to give away things you can hold in your hand. Here's what you can expect: 

- Small fixes or typos === üî• Sticker. 
- Guest post or major code improvements === üëï T-shirt. 
- Course collaboration === üí∞ Paid freelance job or revenue share. 

## How to Fix, Improve, and Create Content via GitHub

First, fork the main repo on GitHub, then clone it to your local machine. You must have Hugo and Node installed. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
{{< highlight text >}}
git clone <your-forked-repo>
npm install
npm run dev

git checkout -b my-fix
{{< /highlight >}}

After making your fix or adding new content, submit a pull request on GitHub. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
{{< highlight text >}}
git commit -m "fix: corrected a typo"
git push origin my-fix
{{< /highlight >}}


## Writing in Markdown

Content is written in [markdown](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#learn-markdown). Posts should only use h2 and h3 tags.

{{< file "md" "some-cool-post.md" >}}
```markdown

Images for lessons are saved in the relative image dir, `lessons/<lesson>/img/` and use the Hugo figure shortcode.

```markdown
{{</* figure src="img/my-images.png" alt="cool image" */>}}
```
