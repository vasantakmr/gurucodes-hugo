## Deploy as Static Site

Note: This method works for static sites that use `getStaticProps` ONLY. Deployment with full SSR requires cloud functions or some other form of a backend server. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
firebase init hosting # select /out as your hosting directory

next build
next export

firebase deploy --only hosting
```


## Deployment with SSR

Video in progress. See the [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) docs for a general idea of the process.
