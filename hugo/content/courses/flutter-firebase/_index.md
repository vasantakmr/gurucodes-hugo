**Flutter Firebase - The Full Course** will take you from zero to a complex production-ready iOS or Android app using real-world cloud infrastructure.

## ‚ö° What will I build?

<span class="tag tag-sm tag-pro">Updated Aug 10th, 2020</span> <span class="tag tag-sm tag-flutter">Flutter v1.12.13</span>

This is a project-based course that will teach you how to build a multiple choice quiz app, inspired by apps like Duolingo and QuizUp. The app implements user authentication (Sign in with Google or Apple), tracks quiz progress in Firestore, runs animations, and shares data between screens. 

A quiz was chosen because it provides a moderate amount of complexity with plenty of variety between learning concepts. My mission is to teach non-trivial concepts without getting bogged down into repetitive or boring tasks.

## ü§î Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is intermediate level and designed to help you become a productive full-stack Flutter app developer. It assumes you have some basic knowledge of programming, ideally in a language similar to JavaScript, C#, or Java. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 


## Is this Course Updated?

The last code review and update was completed on **April 14th, 2020** using Flutter version `1.12.13`. The course receives regular updates, especially to address breaking changes in Flutter and/or Firebase. 


## üèéÔ∏è Test Drive

You can download the app we're building on Google Play or the App Store, so give it a test drive before you enroll.
