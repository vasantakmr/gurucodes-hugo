Now it's time to put some unit tests in place. While this step is optional I highly recommend testing your payment integration because (1) one failed commit could cause you lose out on potential payments, (2) it provides a great playground for rapid development, (3) it will help you better understand your code.

Install [Jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) and the [Firebase Functions Test](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/unit-testing) package.
